IT 347 Computer Networks - Project 1: Chat Server with Client

You will create client and server applications to talk with each other as well as the clients and servers of other class members. Project 1 is a very simple command driven client and server. Project 2 gets a bit more exciting.

This can be written in any programming language. In fact, since every class member is working off the same protocol, you should be able to interface with a client or server written in a different language without a problem. Recommended languages include Python, C#, C/C++, Ruby, Java, Perl,etc.

There are many examples with similar code on the web. It is recommended to use these as examples, but none of them implement the entire project. Just like IT 210 or CS 142, you need to understand how all parts of your code work you may lose points if you cannot adequately explain how pieces of your code work.

Specifications
Server
Open a listener on TCP port 9020.
Implement the server such that (all client commands are case sensitive):
Client open receives a response of "Welcome to <your name>'s chat room<cr><lf>"
Client request "help<cr><lf>" receives a response of a list of the commands and their syntax.
Client request "test: words<cr><lf>" receives a response of "words<cr><lf>"
Client request "name: <chatname><cr><lf>" receives a response of "OK<cr><lf>"
Client request "get<cr><lf>" receives a response of the entire contents of the chat buffer.
Client request "push: <stuff><cr><lf>" receives a response of "OK<cr><lf>" The result is that "<chatname>: <stuff>" is added as a new line to the chat buffer.
Client request "getrange <startline> <endline><cr><lf>" receives a response of lines <startline> through <endline> from the chat buffer. getrange assumes a 0-based buffer. Your client should return lines <startline> <endline>
Client request "SOME UNRECOGNIZED COMMAND<cr><lf>" receives a response "Error: unrecognized command: SOME UNRECOGNIZED COMMAND<cr><lf>"
Client request "adios<cr><lf>" will quit the current connection. Checks for EOF or CLOSE SOCKET.
Socket timeout can be avoided by using the following python code: s.setsockopt(socket.SOL_SOCKET, socket.SO_REUSEADDR, 1)

Similar functionality should be available from the operating system in other programming languages as well.

All requests and responses must be terminated by a <cr><lf>
The appearance of a a <cr><lf> signifies the end of a request or a response.
Client commands can be issued in any order.
If a name hasn't been set use "unknown"
If you extend the protocol as part of your extra features, you must support the original protocol in a backwards compatible manner.
Don't insert extra tabbing/formatting unless it is enabled via a protocol extension.
Client
Run the client by typing: <yourclientprogram> <ipaddress> <port>
Introduce yourself to the server (name: <name>)
use help
use test
use name
use get
use getrange
use adios
All the commands and responses are written out to the screen for checking later.
